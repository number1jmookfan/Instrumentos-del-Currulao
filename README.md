# Instrumentos-del-Currulao

- Small project for a music appreciation class, wanted to learn a little godot
- Image made in Photoshop, sounds taken from this youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@banforarecords and edited out in Audacity
     - Unfortunately the videos only had 11 out of the 20 keys of the marimba individually played, so I could not complete the sound effects for it
