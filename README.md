# Instrumentos del Currulao

- Small project for a music appreciation class I did to learn a little godot
- photo made in photoshop, sounds taken from this youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@banforarecords and isolated with audacity, scripts in gdscript
    - unfortunately the marimba videos only had 11 of the 20 keys individually played, so it is unable to be completed
